(After the longest minute in John&rsquo;s life&hellip;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2020, John transitioned away from personal training and completed a data boot camp to break into the tech industry. In the Spring of 2021, after only three months of officially dating Kelly, John received a call from the US Air Force Academy offering him a job he couldn&rsquo;t turn down. For Kelly, that call meant everything was about to change. What had once been a five-minute drive between them became an hour and a half. Kelly hates driving, hates highways, and still makes the trip almost every weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They filled those weekends in Colorado Springs with hikes at Garden of the Gods, the Manitou Incline, hot springs, camping trips, and plenty of fudge (iykyk). Long distance wasn&rsquo;t easy, but nightly calls, constant FaceTimes, and counting down to the next visit made the distance worth it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, being apart only made it clearer that home was wherever they were together.</p>",

They started before sunrise, guided only by the narrow glow of their headlamps, and climbed steadily through quiet forests and open alpine meadows. Eventually, they crossed above the tree line, where the landscape opened up and every step became more deliberate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After hours of hiking, heavy breathing, and a fair amount of suffering, they reached the summit of Mount Elbert, the tallest 14&rsquo;er in Colorado.
